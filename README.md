 ## Problem Analysis

The problem is to build a math tutoring website. The website should allow users to learn math concepts and practice math problems. The website should also provide users with access to math tutors who can help them with specific problems.

## Design

The website will be built using the Flask framework. The following HTML files will be needed for the application:

* `index.html`: This will be the home page of the website. It will contain a brief overview of the website and links to the different sections of the website.
* `learn.html`: This page will contain the math concepts that users can learn. The concepts will be organized by topic.
* `practice.html`: This page will contain the math problems that users can practice. The problems will be organized by difficulty level.
* `tutors.html`: This page will contain the list of math tutors who are available to help users. The tutors will be listed by name, location, and experience.
* `contact.html`: This page will contain the contact information for the website.

The following routes will be needed for the application:

* `/`: This route will render the home page.
* `/learn`: This route will render the learn page.
* `/practice`: This route will render the practice page.
* `/tutors`: This route will render the tutors page.
* `/contact`: This route will render the contact page.

## Implementation

The following code shows the implementation of the Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/learn')
def learn():
    return render_template('learn.html')

@app.route('/practice')
def practice():
    return render_template('practice.html')

@app.route('/tutors')
def tutors():
    return render_template('tutors.html')

@app.route('/contact')
def contact():
    return render_template('contact.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

## Testing

The following commands can be used to test the application:

```
$ flask run
$ curl http://localhost:5000/
$ curl http://localhost:5000/learn
$ curl http://localhost:5000/practice
$ curl http://localhost:5000/tutors
$ curl http://localhost:5000/contact
```

The output of these commands should be the HTML pages for the different sections of the website.
